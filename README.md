==========================================API Documentation=================================

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API..<br><br>An API allows one piece of software talk to another. An API is analogous to a power outlet. Without a power outlet, what would you have to do to power your laptop?

<li>Open the wall</ol><br>
<li>Unsheath wires<br>
<li>Splice wires together<br>
<li>Understand all the wires in the wall<br><br>
An API defines how a programmer can write one piece of software to talk to an existing applicationâ€™s features or even build entirely new applications.
  <br><br><b>Types of API:-</b><br>
<li><i>Web APIs</i></li>
Web APIs are APIs that can be accessed using the HTTP protocol. The API defines endpoints, and valid request and response formats. Web APIs include the APIs used to communicate with the browser (see  list). They may be services such as web notifications and web storage. Different web APIs feature varying levels of security and privacy, including open, internal and partner APIs. Multiple web APIs can be combined into a composite API - a collection of data or service APIs.

<li><i>Open APIs</i></li>
Open APIs, also known as external or public APIs, are available to developers and other users with minimal restrictions. They may require registration, and use of an API key, or may be completely open. They are intended for external users (developers at other companies, for example) to access data or services. As an example, take a look at the  provided by the UK government. Any developer can access it, without even registering, allowing app builders to include governmental data on restaurant standards in their apps.

<li><i>Internal APIs</i></li>
In contrast to open APIs, internal APIs are designed to be hidden from external users. They are used within a company to share resources. They allow different teams or sections of a business to consume each otherâ€™s tools, data and programs. Using internal APIs has several advantages over conventional integration techniques, including security and access control, an audit trail of system access, and a standard interface for connecting multiple services.

<li><i>Partner APIs</i></li>
Partner APIs are technically similar to open APIs, but they feature restricted access, often controlled through a third-party API gateway. They are usually intended for a specific purpose, such as providing access to a paid-for service. This is a very common pattern in software as a service ecosystem.

<li><i>Composite APIs</i></li>
Composite APIs allow developers to access several endpoints in one call. These could be different endpoints of a single API, or they could be multiple services or data sources. Composite APIs are especially useful in microservice architectures, where a user may need information from several services to perform a single task. Using composite APIs can reduce server load and improve application performance, as one call can return all the data a user needs.
